**Description:** **Security Impact Analysis**

**Vulnerability 1: Sensitive File - /.git/config: Critical leak discovered**

**Risk Level:** High

**Description:** The presence of a `.git/config` file in the root directory of the website indicates that the repository is publicly accessible, potentially exposing sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other configuration details.

**Impact:**

1. **Exposure of sensitive data**: The `.git/config` file may contain sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other configuration details, which can be used by attackers to compromise the system.
2. **Unauthorized access**: The presence of a `.git` repository in the root directory may allow attackers to access the repository and potentially modify the codebase.
3. **Reputation damage**: The exposure of sensitive information can damage the reputation of the organization and erode customer trust.

**Verification Steps:**

1. **Check the presence of the `.git` directory**: Use a web browser or a tool like `curl` to access the website's root directory: `curl https://getzenbasket.com/`
2. **Verify the contents of the `.git/config` file**: Use a tool like `curl` to access the `.git/config` file: `curl https://getzenbasket.com/.git/config`
3. **Check for sensitive information**: Review the contents of the `.git/config` file for sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other configuration details.

**Remediation Steps:**

1. **Remove the `.git` directory**: Delete the `.git` directory from the website's root directory to prevent unauthorized access to the repository.
2. **Secure sensitive information**: Review the contents of the `.git/config` file and remove any sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys.
3. **Configure Git to ignore sensitive files**: Add a `.gitignore` file to the repository to ignore sensitive files, such as database credentials or API keys.
