# CyberMoranda-Defence-
CyberMoranda Defence is a modular Android security ecosystem built entirely in Python using Termux. It is designed for security research, privacy auditing, and defensive monitoring — without root access. This project focuses on real, explainable security logic, not fake AI or simulated scans.
